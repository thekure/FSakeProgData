## 11.1

### i)

The lenc function can be found in .\Assignment10\Assignment10\Program.fs

### ii)

The result will be multiplied by 2

### iii)

The leni function can be found in .\Assignment10\Assignment10\Program.fs

Continuation takes the result of one iteration and uses it as parameter for the next.

Tail-recursion computes and return the resulting accumulator.

If you were to have the same functionality as seen in ii) in the tail-recursive function you would have to change the function itself, where you can just change the id parameter in case of continuation.

## 11.2

### i)

The revc function can be found in .\Assignment10\Assignment10\Program.fs

### ii)

The resulting list will be the given list reversed and concatinated on itself.

### iii)

The revi function can be found in .\Assignment10\Assignment10\Program.fs

## 11.3

The prodc function can be found in .\Assignment10\Assignment10\Program.fs

## 11.4

The improved prodc (called impprodc) and the prodi function can be found in .\Assignment10\Assignment10\Program.fs
